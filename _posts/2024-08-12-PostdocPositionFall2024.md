**Postdoctoral Positions in Particle Physics and Cosmology at the University of Coimbra, Portugal**

The Centre for Physics of the University of Coimbra (CFisUC) invites applications for two Postdoctoral positions in Particle Physics and Cosmology. The positions are funded through the FCT-CERN project "Topological defects as a probe of new physics: from CMB birefringence to gravitational waves" led by Dr. Ricardo Z. Ferreira and including researchers from different research institutes in Portugal and Spain.

The successful candidates are expected to work on the project's tasks, related to Axion Physics and the phenomenology of Topological Defects in the Early Universe. The candidates will work in close collaboration with Dr. Ricardo Z. Ferreira and will be part of an international team and a stimulating scientific environment.

Qualifications:
- A PhD in Physics or a closely related field is required at the time of application. The PhD diploma cannot be older than three years.
- Strong background in Cosmology; experience in Axion Physics and/or Topological Defects is desirable but not mandatory.
- Demonstrated ability to conduct independent research and collaborate effectively within a research team.
 
Position Details:
The position is for one year, with the possibility of an extension depending on external funding. The expected start date is November 1st, 2024, or as soon as possible thereafter.
Interested candidates should submit the following documents to rzferreira[at]uc.pt:
